React project where data is displayed from an open API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## How does it work
You can display data from albums and posts of a specific user. As task specifications didn't mention how to handle user information, for testing purposes user id is hard coded and the application shows data for user id 1.

Categories are shown on the left side in a vertical navigation bar and category name is displayed on top of the page. As data is being fetched, you can see the spinner, at least briefly depending on the time of the response. UI is made with reactstrap.

## Future development
The current app only fetches data from the open API but it could easily be developed further. Deleting and editing content would be easy to add. Currently there's element overlap in terms of mobile responsiveness of the site so the UI needs to be improved. On desktops the site looks as the specs required. Additionally, design and styling could be modified and made more consistent in the future to make the application appealing for the user.
